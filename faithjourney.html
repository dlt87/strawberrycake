            <h1>Hey! My Blessed Edmund Rice Element is to "Pursue Excellence in All Endevaours."</h1>
            <p>. . . . . . . .</p>
   
            <p>I chose this element as my capstone mainly revolves around bettering my skills and using them to the best of my ability to impact others. By learning to code, learning new instruments, and sharing my experiences and projects, my aim is to inspire others to follow their passions and use the gifts that God has given us to the best of our abilities.</p>

          <h1>Challenges I faced:</h1>
          <p>. . . . . . . .</p>
          <p>Some challenges that I faced included my own personal skill limits of coding, music production, and hardware limits.
            <br>At home, my computer sometimes struggles to run programs such as the ones I use to create these games and render the music files but I worked around this by collaborating with my friends and using the school computers/their own computers.
            <br>Other challenges I faced included time constraints with meeting with the students I taught, but this was only a miniscule inconvience as we had the entire year to meet up during the specified Game Dev meeting times.

          <h1>What I learned and What I would change:</h1>
          <p>. . . . . . . .</p>
          <p>What I learned from this Capstone Project is that maybe I'm not exactly cut out to teach others YET but that I do enjoy seeing the progress that other people make as well as the joy that comes with it.
            <br>I enjoy seeing improvements made not only in others, but in myself through teaching others and by continuing my own self-improvement journey whether it is taking criticism from others or from taking time to reflect on myself.
            <br>. . .
            <br>
            Something that I would've changed is to be more specific in my teaching and refine my teaching skills by practicing by myself (although the bar was set pretty low). 
            <br>Additionally, I would have narrowed the topic of my capstone as there are many different aspects that I attempted to tie together, the main ones being Programming, Music, and Teaching.

          <h1>The Future:</h1>
          <p>. . . . . . . .</p>
          <p>As for the future, I will continue to lead the Game Development Club as one of the Co-Chairs, along with Victoria Del Rosario and Jendayi Bernardo as I hope to pass on the knowledge and wisdom to the younger grades when we graduate
